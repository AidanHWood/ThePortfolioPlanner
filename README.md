# ThePortfolioPlanner
This is my first ever project created in Python, I know... its not very good and is nothing special, but was just something to mess around with. It makes use of libraries such as CustomTkinter, Matplotlib and uses Google Calendar API.

This was created and submitted for my A-Level Coursework project

For security reasons, the credentials.json and token.json files have been removed from this repo. Therefore the Google Calendar API feature within this code wont function.

However, the other elements of this code should function providing that you install the relative libraries. 

Thanks :)
